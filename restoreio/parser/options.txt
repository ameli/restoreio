Required arguments:

    -i --input                Input filename. This should be the full path.
                              Input file extension can be *.nc or *.ncml.
    -o --output               Output filename. This should be full path. Output
                              file extension should be *.nc file.
                              If option '-p' is specified with positive time
                              frame, the '-o' option is not required.

Optional arguments:

    -h --help                 Prints this help message.
    -v --version              Prints the version and author info.
    -d --difusivity[=float]   Diffusivity of the PDE solver (real number).
                              Large number: diffusion dominant,
                              Small numbers: Advection dominant.
    -s --sweep                Sweeps the PDE solution in all flipped directions
                              of image. This ensures an even solution
                              independent of direction. 
    -p --plot                 Instead of iterating through all time frames,
                              only solves the given time frame in option -t,
                              and plots results. If uncertainty quantification
                              is enabled with -u, the plot option will plot
                              figures for the statistical analysis for the time
                              frame in  option -t.
    -L --exclude-land[=int]   Enables/disables the exclusion of land an ocean.
                              Otherwise the entire domain is treated as ocean.
                              - L 0: Does not exclude land from ocean. All data
                                are treated as in the ocean.
                              - L 1: Excludes ocean and land. Most accurate,
                                slowest.
                              - L 2: Excludes ocean and land. Less accurate,
                                fastest.
                              - L 3: Excludes ocean and land. Currently this
                                option is not working.
    -l --include-nearshore    Includes the ocean area between data domain
                              (convex/concave hull) and the shore. This fills
                              the gap up to the coast. This is only effective
                              if '-L' is used so that the land is separated to
                              the ocean.
    -c --convex               Instead of using concave hull (alpha shape), this
                              options uses convex hull of the area.
    -a --alpha[=float]        The alpha number for alpha shape. If not
                              specified or a negative number, it is computed.
                              This option is only for concave shapes. Hence
                              '-a, --alpha' is ineffective if using '-c'.
    -r --refine[=int]         Refines the grid. Int set to 1, this is the
                              original grid without refinement. 2, 3, etc
                              refines grid in each axes. Default is 1.
    -t --time-frame[=int]     The time to plot or process the uncertainty
                              quantification. Default is -1, the last time.
    -u --uncertainty          Enables uncertainty quantification for the time
                              frame in option -t. This either produces
                              results in output file in option -o, or plots
                              results with option -p.
    -e --num-ensembles[=int]  Number of ensembles used for uncertainty
                              quantification. Default is 1000.
    -m --min-file             Minimum file iterator string, to be used for
                              processing multiple files, like -m 003 -n 012
                              If this option is used, the -n or --max-file
                              option should also be used.
    -n --max-file             Maximum file iterator string, to be used for
                              processing multiple files, like -m 003 -n 012
                              If this option is used, the -m or --min-file
                              option should also be used.
